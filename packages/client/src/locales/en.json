Note: Findings may be refined with a more detailed assessment.\n\n**Full Accessibility Assessment** provides an extensive evaluation of digital products, thoroughly identifying a full range of accessibility issues. Key features:\n- Incorporates various configurations, tools, and assistive technologies.\n- Customizable scope to target specific parts of the product.\n- Produces a prioritized backlog of issues and provides a detailed snapshot of the application's accessibility conformance.\n- Ideal for an in-depth understanding and documentation of accessibility barriers, offering accurate accessibility conformance reports and actionable deliverables.\n- Particularly valuable for teams seeking to improve accessibility compliance and strategies, providing a deeper analysis compared to the Rapid Accessibility Assessment.",
